## Consolidated Food Delivery Platform  
### Abstract
Our project aims to develop a unique, consolidated food delivery platform that integrates multiple popular food delivery services such as Grab Food and Foodpanda. This platform allows users to view food options, delivery services, and fees from various companies collectively, helping them make cost-effective choices and save time. This initiative fosters healthy competition among delivery companies and potentially stimulates economic growth in the industry. User testing validated the core integrity of the web application, paving the way for future enhancements.

### Outcomes
The primary milestone achieved is enabling users to create and log in to their accounts on our desktop site, navigate through various restaurant and food categories, and compare prices across different delivery partners. Users can proceed to checkout, access payment options, track orders, and view order histories. We also implemented a profile page where users can alter their basic account settings. The goal is to ensure smooth navigation between these features without any complications.

### Introduction
Our team employed extensive research and planning to develop the first iteration of our web application. We organized our team into three front-end developers and two back-end developers. The front-end team focused on presenting content in a user-friendly manner, while the back-end team developed the foundational functionality. This report includes detailed documentation of the development process, the adoption of the Scrum methodology, user and unit testing, and the tools utilized. The report concludes with an analysis and evaluation of our project and product.

### Planning and Research
We allocated time and resources effectively, breaking down tasks between the front-end and back-end teams. We documented our meetings and considered various frameworks and project management tools such as ClickUp, Burndown Charts, and Gantt Charts.

### Prototyping and Iteration
Our process included developing low, medium, and high-fidelity wireframes, each evaluated against initial concepts. We identified essential features to implement and made iterative design changes based on user feedback.

### System Development
The code development phase involved version control processes, unit testing, and addressing implementation challenges. We documented our sprint retrospectives and provided evidence of module coupling to ensure the quality of our codebase.

### Analysis
Our project analysis highlighted the success metrics based on the Scrum methodology. Despite some challenges, the team demonstrated high levels of teamwork and collaboration.

### Evaluation
We evaluated both the project and the product comprehensively. While we succeeded in launching 95% of the intended features, we adopted a dynamic workflow mindset to facilitate future enhancements and iterations.

### Conclusion
The project successfully delivered a functional demo version of the application. Moving forward, we aim to refine and expand the platform, incorporating additional features based on user feedback and industry trends.

### Personal Reflection
As the Scrum Master, I facilitated effective communication and healthy discussions among team members. As a back-end developer, I worked extensively with MySQL queries and RESTful API calls, utilizing libraries like Axios and Express to manage data interactions effectively.
