# Background  
## Abstract    
The foundation of this project is to create a unique, consolidated food delivery platform
applicable to all users of popular food delivery services (e.g. Grab Food, Foodpanda etc.). In
contrast to using a specific food delivery service provider, users can now view food options,
delivery services and fees from multiple companies collectively within our software. This will
aid all users of essential food delivery services in making more cost-effective options while
saving time. Also, this creates healthy competition in the industry for the different food
delivery companies and opens doors for new economic growth in the business.
Based on results from our User Testing research, our team has successfully run the
fundamental integrity of the web application with the intention to progress the software
further in the near future.  

## Introduction  
At the current stage, our team has deployed various research and planning efforts to
facilitate our web application's first fully functioning iteration, which we will discuss further in
the next section. We have structured our team with three front-end developers and two back-
end developers working on the project concurrently. Our front-end team are tasked with
presenting our content in the most user-friendly manner, closely abiding by the research we
had done in our initial report. Our back-end team will be creating the basic functionality and
foundation for the web application we aim to accomplish at this stage. Our initial conceptual
report will be the guiding principle in this project's developmental stage. We will refer to all
the research, planning timelines and prototypes that were done prior.
This report will consist of thorough research on the actual web application development,
documentation of how our team adopted the scrum methodology, user testing and unit
testing processes, and the tools that were considered and utilised in the process. We will
conclude with an analysis and evaluation of our project and product.  

## Outcomes  
The overall goal for our team at the current milestone is to enable users to create an account
and log in to an account on our desktop site, where they will be automatically redirected to
the web application's home page. From there, users should be able to navigate to a myriad
of restaurant and categorical options, make their selection of food items and view the price
comparison for it with the different delivery partners and then proceed to a checkout page.
Ergo, users can access a payment methods page, track their orders, and view their existing
order histories. We are also looking to include a profile page with options for users to access
multiple basic account-altering services such as a change in name, password or email.
In its entirety, we hope that our team can successfully deliver the functions mentioned above
while ensuring that navigation between these pages runs smoothly with no issues or
complications.
